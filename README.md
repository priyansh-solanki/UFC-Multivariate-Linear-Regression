# UFC Multivariate Linear Regression
- Built a Multiple Linear Regression model from scratch using Numpy, Pandas, and other concepts of OOP in Python, cost functions, and gradient descent algorithm.
- Performed descriptive data analysis on UFC data, gained insights and answered 8+ questions for better understandability of the dataset.
- Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the data and its information and further visualized heatmap of correlations to define 17+ independent variables with more than 40% correlation.
